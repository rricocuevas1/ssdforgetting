# Stochastic Submodular Data Forgetting

This repository contains the code and data of the paper Stochastic Submodular Data Forgetting.

## Requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Download
The data can be automatically downloaded by running the following command:
```bash
python prepare_data.py
```

Alternatively, you can download the data manually.
The data is hosted on Google Drive. You can download it using the following link:

- [Download Data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YjCt-RZUyEHslqmA3yJHJi-Tk6SNFlbP/view?usp=sharing)

Once you download it please unzip it and place it in the same directory as the source files.

## Experiment reproducibility

In order to replicate our experiments please run the following command:

```
chmod +x run_tmux_sessions.sh
./run_tmux_sessions.sh
```

This will run every experiment 10 times. To integrate the results, please run the following command:

```
python process_results.py
```

This will create the final solution files for each one of the experiments. Each file containins the standard deviation
and average of the quality and runtime for IndepDF, DepDF, LAZY GREEDY, and QUERY-BASED-AMNESIA for the corresponding
experiment described by each one of the file names.

## General Usage

In order to run `IndepDF` and `DepDF` (this paper) vs `LAZY GREEDY` and `QUERY-BASED-AMNESIA` (baselines) please execute
the following command:

```
python main.py [dataset_choice] [percentage_of_db] [percentage_of_ql] [budget] [n_iterations] [av_stdevs_calculation] [only_time]
```

The command line arguments correspond to:

- `[dataset_choice]`: The desired dataset $D$ inside the `sample_data` folder. Select one from the
  list [flight, photo, wiki].
- `[percentage_of_db]`: The percentage of $D$ to use as input data. Select a number inside the continuous
  interval [0, 1].
- `[percentage_of_ql]`: The percentage of queries from the corresponding query-log $Q$ to use as input log. Select a
  number inside the continuous interval [0, 1].
- `[budget]`: The budget $B$ is the percentage of $D$ to be kept. Select a number inside the continuous interval [0,1].
- `[n_iterations]`: The number of gradient ascent iterations $T$ the `DepDF` routine will perform. Select a number from
  the list [2000, 10000, 50000, 100000].
- `[av_stdevs_calculation]`: Whether the average answer set diversity is computed or not. Select `0` (False) not to
  perform the calculation, and `1` (True) to perform it.
- `[only_time]`: Whether $f(D*)$ is evaluated or not for solution $D*$ or only the time taken to build $D*$ is reported.
  Select `0` (False) to return both the time and function evaluation and `1` (True) to just return the time.

An example is given in the code snippet below,

```
python main.py flight 1 0.25 0.01 2000 0 0
```

In this example $D$ equals the full flights dataset, $Q$ is the 25% of the query-log, $B$ is 1% of $|D|$, $T= 2000$, the
average answer set diversity is not computed, and both the time taken to build $D*$ and $f(D*)$ are reported.
